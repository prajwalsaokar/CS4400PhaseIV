# CS4400 PhaseIV

Welcome to our app, the Business Supply System. This application was written in C# using the .NET 9.0 library. The app can be built with dotnet 9.0 installed (on a macbook you can do this by running brew install dotnet), and going into the BusinessAPI directory and running dotnet build. From there run `cd BusinessAPI` and then `dotnet run` to run the application. You can find our API documentation at http://localhost:5080/swagger/index.html and the actual application at http://localhost:5080/Index. We chose to use .NET because of our experience developing backends in C#/.NET at previous internships and the powerful libraries (Dapper) that .NET has to map objects with results from raw SQL and stored procedures. The frontend was written in Razor Pages, which is one of .NET's libraries for creating dynamic HTML. Tanay handled most of the frontend and integration work (ie: rendering tables, serializing data so that it could be rendered on the web, and fixing up our sproc shell) and I handled most of the backend work (creating objects for our data, using Dapper to integrate our application code with the stored procedures, writing handlers for GET/POST requests from the frontend, etc.)
